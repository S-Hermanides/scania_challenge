# Scania truck failure challenge

Welcome to my repo containing my code for the Scania truck challenge, which can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/scania-truck-failures/overview/description).

The main modeling and exploration is performed in the modeling_updated.ipynb file. The file is annotated to show the steps being performed.

The final model was deployed in a simple app, which can be found in app.py and run locally from the command line (using streamlit)
